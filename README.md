# BikeRental-App
Web application dedicated to handling and managing of bike rental service.

## General Information

The idea of the project appeared in my and my friends heads during one of conversation we had.
We were looking for idea of project for our university classes.
We wanted to develop the app to support bike rental businesses and present them free tool
to handle with renting bicycle management and bicycle service management.
We have created the project and started to develop the app having great fun during building its components. My role was to create frontend and backend that handle tasks. Rest of the team work on cloud infrastructure to host the project.

This repo is clone of the part of the project I was responsible for and it was done in order to add some additional code to extend functionality of the app, to fix some bugs or add some good practise.
